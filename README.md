## 📖 Executive Summary
This project implements a **Multi-Factor Quantitative Model** to analyze and rank global semiconductor companies across US, Hong Kong, and Taiwan markets. 

Unlike traditional fundamental analysis, this model utilizes statistical normalization (**Z-Score**) to synthesize disparate metrics—Valuation, Innovation, Quality, and Momentum—into a unified scoring system (0-100). The goal is to identify "Quality Growth" stocks that are undervalued relative to their R&D output.

## 🏗️ Methodology & Framework

The model follows a rigorous quantitative research pipeline:

### 1. Data Engineering (Cross-Market Normalization)
* **Source:** Institutional financial terminal (iFind/Tonghuashun).
* **Universe:** 15+ Core Semiconductor companies (NVDA, TSM, ASML, SMIC, etc.) covering Fabless, Foundry, and Equipment sectors.
* **Currency Standardization:** All market capitalizations (HKD, TWD) are normalized to **USD** to ensure accurate cross-border comparison.
* **Imputation:** Missing data points (e.g., specific quarterly reports) are handled using sector-median imputation.

### 2. Factor Construction
We constructed four distinct factor dimensions to capture the "Alpha":

| Dimension | Weight | Key Indicators | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Innovation** | **30%** | `R&D Intensity` (R&D / Revenue) | In Semi, R&D is the leading indicator of future moat. |
| **Quality** | **30%** | `Gross Margin` + `ROIC` | Filters for companies with high pricing power and capital efficiency. |
| **Valuation** | **20%** | `EV/EBITDA` | Preferred over P/E due to high depreciation in the sector. |
| **Momentum** | **20%** | `YTD Return` | Captures market trend and sentiment alignment. |

### 3. The Scoring Algorithm
To combine metrics with different units (e.g., 125x P/E vs. 6% R&D), we apply **Z-Score Normalization**:

$$z_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma}$$

The final Composite Score ($S$) is calculated as:

$$S = 0.3(Z_{Innovation}) + 0.3(Z_{Quality}) - 0.2(Z_{Valuation}) + 0.2(Z_{Momentum})$$

*(Note: Valuation is penalized, so lower EV/EBITDA contributes positively to the score)*

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings (Backtest Snapshot)

Running the model on **December 2025** data revealed several market anomalies:

1.  **The "R&D Alpha" Outlier:** **SMIC (0981.HK)** ranked #1 due to an exceptionally high R&D Intensity (>50%), signaling aggressive capital commitment despite geopolitical headwinds.
2.  **Valuation Drag on Giants:** **Nvidia (NVDA)**, despite dominating Quality and Momentum, ranked mid-tier (#11) in this GARP-focused model due to its extreme valuation premium (>120x EV/EBITDA).
3.  **The "Cycle Turn" Winner:** **Micron (MU)** ranked #2, driven by a massive Momentum reversal (+185% YTD) combined with reasonable valuation, indicating a classic memory cycle upswing.
